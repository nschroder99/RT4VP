            <div class="heading-line"></div>
            <p>&emsp;&emsp;Hi! My name is Rebecca Torrence, and I’m a first-year currently serving as a Senator on the Services and Sustainability Committee of DSG. I’m double majoring in Neuroscience and Linguistics with a minor in Computer Science. I’m also a member of Illyria and the Wesley Methodist group, a Huang Fellow, and I do club jiu jitsu! You can find me walking across campus to the beat of loud alt rock music, running in the gardens, or screaming about Chem 101 in TrinCaf. I never take off my leather jacket, but that’s just part of my charm.</p>

            <h2>What is Services and Sustainability?</h2>
            <div class="heading-line"></div>
            <p>The DSG Services and Sustainability Committee (or SAS for short) oversees projects for all campus facilities and services. For example, Duke dining, the Wellness Center, the Career Center, transportation, and environmental initiatives are all included in SAS’s purview. Senators work on individual projects, as many as they want, that will affect these facilities and resources. 
The Vice President of Services and Sustainability runs the committee. This entails overseeing the projects of their Senators and mentoring them while working on projects of their own. They are also a member of the Executive Board of DSG. The level of involvement of a VP also allows them to affect much greater, lasting change than Senators, because they are given the authority and connections to make their ideas heard at a higher and more impactful level.

        	<div class="heading-line"></div>
            <h7>&emsp;&emsp;When I first came to Duke, I was immediately confronted with a completely new culture surrounding mental health. From the outside, it looks like our university is entirely invested in our mental health, that we have every resource we need to be happy, so we must have it all together. However, I quickly realized that this wasn’t the case. Not only are many of the resources flawed, but mental health and overall wellness isn’t recognized by many students as a genuine priority. That’s why I ran for a position as Senator on Services and Sustainability. I wanted to change that culture.<br></h7>
			<h7> &emsp;&emsp;I have spent my time on Services and Sustainability striving to increase mental health awareness and give students, both those incoming and already on campus, an opportunity to take their wellbeing into their own hands. It has been an incredible experience and I’ve loved every second. But in order for this impact to be permanent, there need to be progressive alterations made to the system itself.<br></h7>
			<h7>&emsp;&emsp;I’m running for VP because I want to take my passion for the student body and your ideas to institute the kind of change that will last. As VP, I will use my influence to make changes that alter the institutional resources themselves to cater to student needs, while increasing awareness and expanding resources for the areas of wellness often overlooked, like sexual health, sexual assault prevention, alcohol abuse, and the mental health of those marginalized.<br></h7>
			<h7>&emsp;&emsp;This is my vision, and it is one that I know I can achieve. I am determined, I am ambitious, and I am relentless. I will push my senators to serve you reliably and with accountability to create projects that will benefit you next year. And I will push myself until my plans become a reality that will benefit this university for years to come.<br></h7>
